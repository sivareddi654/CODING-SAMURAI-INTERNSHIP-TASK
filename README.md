Number Guessing Game (GUI) – Python

Developed a graphical number guessing game using Tkinter. Thprogram randomly selects a number and provides feedback such as “Too High” or “Too Low” based on user input. This project improved my understanding of GUI design, event handling, and logical problem-solving in Python.
